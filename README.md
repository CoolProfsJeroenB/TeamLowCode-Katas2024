## Welcome

Welcome to the LowCodes Architectural Kata challenge by O'Reilly.
We are consultants working for [CoolProfs](https://www.coolprofs.com/en/about/coolprofs/) a company who specializes in building applications with Enterprise Grade Low-Code. 

To challenge ourselves and keep on learning we decided to commit our team to the O'Reilly Kata. This challenge took us out of our comfort zone and already delivered valuable new insights.

We believe that it does not matter if you build software in a high or low-code environment. Architecture is equally important to deliver a good solution. 

In our work we do not only design it we also build and implement it. To help ourselves and our clients to always have an up-to-date architectural overview of their software landscape we believe in the power of automation. We use [C4 Modeling approach](https://c4model.com/) to design and automatically generate it from code to allows us a continuous comparison between designed architecture and the realised architecture.
